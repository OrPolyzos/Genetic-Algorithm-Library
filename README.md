# Genetic-Algorithm-Library
Provides an abstract implementation of a Genetic Algorithm.

## Details
The project at hand in this repository is not actually the Genetic Algorithm Library, but it does include it as a sub-module, 
in order to better demonstrate the way it should be implemented.<br/><br/>

Example implementations:
* <em>Infinite Monkey Theorem (ITM)</em><br/>
A rather simple example, with console-output just to show the usage of the library.
* <em>Convex Hull Problem (CH)</em><br/>
A more complex example, in order to demonstrate how the library and genetic algorithm flow can be configured to fit any needs.
Also a basic UI is provided for this one.
